6.3.  Content-encryption Process

   The content-encryption key for the desired content-encryption
   algorithm is randomly generated.  The data to be protected is padded
   as described below, then the padded data is encrypted using the
   content-encryption key.  The encryption operation maps an arbitrary
   string of octets (the data) to another string of octets (the
   ciphertext) under control of a content-encryption key.  The encrypted
   data is included in the EnvelopedData encryptedContentInfo
   encryptedContent OCTET STRING.

   Some content-encryption algorithms assume the input length is a
   multiple of k octets, where k is greater than one.  For such
   algorithms, the input shall be padded at the trailing end with
   k-(lth mod k) octets all having value k-(lth mod k), where lth is
   the length of the input.  In other words, the input is padded at
   the trailing end with one of the following strings:

                     01 -- if lth mod k = k-1
                  02 02 -- if lth mod k = k-2
                      .
                      .
                      .
            k k ... k k -- if lth mod k = 0

   The padding can be removed unambiguously since all input is padded,
   including input values that are already a multiple of the block size,
   and no padding string is a suffix of another.  This padding method is
   well defined if and only if k is less than 256.
